Matrix Multiplication in C

This C program performs the multiplication of two matrices and outputs the result.
The user is prompted to input the dimensions and elements of two matrices, and the
program checks if the multiplication is possible. If the number of columns in the 
first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix, it computes the result and displays it.

Features
Prompts the user for matrix dimensions and elements.
Validates if matrix multiplication is possible.
Outputs the resulting matrix after multiplication.
Code Structure
multiplyMatrices(): Multiplies two matrices.
printMatrix(): Displays a matrix.
main(): Takes user input and handles matrix initialization and validation
